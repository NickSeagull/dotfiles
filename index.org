* Welcome to nickseagull.dev

This site is an experimentation platform and portal into my development environment, notes, tools, and thoughts.

Everything you see here — from system configuration to personal wiki and blog — is written in Emacs Org-mode, and published directly from source.

- 🧬 Dotfiles and system setup for all my machines
- 🧠 Notes, ideas, and references (a digital garden)
- 🛠️ Scripts and utilities I use daily
- 🌐 Blog posts and writing

All content lives in the same unified system.
There is no separation between code, config, and knowledge.

Feel free to explore, browse, or adapt anything you find useful.

This site is built from the same files I use to run my machines and organize my thoughts.
