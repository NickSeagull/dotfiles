#+TITLE: Exporting to Org Mode

Here's an example script on how to export. Ideally this should be converted into an automatic script that exports automatically

#+begin_src elisp
(require 'package)
(package-initialize)
(require 'ox-hugo)

;; Adjust paths to match your repo
(setq org-hugo-base-dir "./website/src/content/docs")
(find-file "./index.org")
(org-hugo-export-wim-to-md :all-subtrees)
#+end_src
