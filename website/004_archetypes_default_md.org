This file defines the default [[https://gohugo.io/content-management/archetypes/][archetype]] used by Hugo when creating new content with `hugo new`.

Archetypes in Hugo are content templates that pre-fill front matter when generating new pages or posts. This helps maintain consistency across entries and reduces repetitive manual setup.

The template below sets the following fields dynamically:

- ~date~: Inserts the current date/time when the file is generated.
- ~draft~: Marks the content as a draft by default, so it's excluded from public builds.
- ~title~: Uses the filename (with hyphens replaced by spaces and capitalized) as the title of the new content.
