#+TITLE: JavaScript Module Resolution (jsconfig.json)
#+DATE: <2025-03-23 Sun>

This file defines JavaScript module resolution settings for the assets pipeline, specifically for code editors like VS Code that support `jsconfig.json`.

It improves developer ergonomics by allowing **import path autocompletion and resolution** for libraries managed through Hugo Modules. These paths point to local caches of JS libraries brought in via Hugo's Go module system.

In this setup:

- ~baseUrl~ is set to `"."`, meaning imports are resolved from the project root.
- ~paths~ are configured so that:
  - ~popperjs@v2~ and ~bootstrap@v5~ JavaScript modules are correctly resolved for tooling,
  - even though they’re cached deep inside Hugo's internal file structure.

This setup does **not** affect actual Hugo builds or bundling — it's only for development/editor support.
