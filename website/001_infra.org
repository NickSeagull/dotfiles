#+TITLE: About the infrastructure to generate the site
#+DATE: <2025-03-23 Sun>
#+hugo_section: docs/website

The site is written using Org-mode.

All content lives in =.org= files that serve multiple purposes: they act as a personal knowledge base, documentation, configuration hub, and code generator. Many files include source blocks that can be *tangled* into actual scripts or config files â€” this allows me to maintain a single source of truth across systems.

For static site generation, I use *Astro* with *Starlight*.

While exporting I use my elisp function =ns/hugo-export-org-files-in-dir=. Setting
the Org root to the root of this repo, and the Hugo root to the =src= folder
in this folder (website). Also, I will use =ns/tangle-org-files-in-dir= to generate all source files out of the source blocks.
