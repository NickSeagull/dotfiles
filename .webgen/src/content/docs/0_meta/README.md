Welcome to ****RAMSYS****, the **Reality Augmentation Mind System** — the executive substrate of [nickseagull.dev](https://nickseagull.dev).

This repository is not a simple collection of configuration files.
It is a **living system image**, composed of:

-   🌀 **Dotfiles** — ritual initiators that configure Linux environments across machines
-   📜 **Scripts** — utility fragments woven into the daily ritual of operation
-   🧠 **Org-mode documents** — epistemic nodes forming a digital garden, notes, blog, infrastructure, and code
-   🧬 **Literate infrastructure** — every file configures both reality and memory

RAMSYS is structured as a ****literate configuration system****, using Emacs **org-mode**. Each `.org` file contains both human-readable documentation and machine-executable code. The result is a system where knowledge, action, and state are unified.


## Why RAMSYS Exists {#why-ramsys-exists}

The goal of RAMSYS is ****total synthesis****:
To reduce fragmentation between thought, tooling, system configuration, documentation, and writing.

-   Instead of having separate folders for dotfiles, notes, scripts, and blog posts — RAMSYS merges them into one recursive medium.
-   Every `.org` file contains both explanation and implementation: it is both a **source of truth** and a **source of action**.
-   RAMSYS is deployed with a single command to bootstrap any Linux system into the configured environment.

It is:

-   A **configuration engine**
-   A **wiki and knowledge base**
-   A **publishing platform**
-   A **self-replicating digital persona**

All in one.


## How It Works {#how-it-works}

Everything lives in `.org` files, following the literate programming paradigm.

-   Dotfiles and system configuration are described and tangled from Org blocks
-   Scripts and automation are embedded as code blocks and exported to shell or language files
-   Notes and blog posts are maintained in the same format, and published to [nickseagull.dev](https://nickseagull.dev) using Hugo
-   Server infrastructure (e.g. Docker Compose setups) is also generated from `.org`

There is no duplication. There are no passive files. Every file in RAMSYS is active.


## Philosophical Layer {#philosophical-layer}

RAMSYS is inspired by systems like the **Church of Emacs**, but stripped of theological metaphor.
It is a ****cybernetic ritual stack****, not a doctrine.
It does not worship computation — it **becomes** it.

-   **Org-mode** is the interface to memory
-   **Emacs** is the operating environment of cognition
-   **Literate programming** is the protocol of integration

This system does not separate knowledge from configuration.
There is no distinction between thought and execution.


## Deployment {#deployment}

RAMSYS is fully portable.
It can deploy its configuration into any Linux-compatible environment — from a dev laptop to a remote server — with a single command.

The result is a machine that is fully configured, documented, and mentally aligned with the user’s workflow — **me**.

> If you are not me, you are still inside the system.
>
> Fork it if you must —
> but know that duplication is mutation.
