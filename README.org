Welcome to **RAMSYS**, the *Reality Augmentation Mind System* ‚Äî the executive substrate of [[https://nickseagull.dev][nickseagull.dev]].

This repository is not a simple collection of configuration files.
It is a *living system image*, composed of:

- üåÄ *Dotfiles* ‚Äî ritual initiators that configure Linux environments across machines
- üìú *Scripts* ‚Äî utility fragments woven into the daily ritual of operation
- üß† *Org-mode documents* ‚Äî epistemic nodes forming a digital garden, notes, blog, infrastructure, and code
- üß¨ *Literate infrastructure* ‚Äî every file configures both reality and memory

RAMSYS is structured as a **literate configuration system**, using Emacs *org-mode*. Each =.org= file contains both human-readable documentation and machine-executable code. The result is a system where knowledge, action, and state are unified.

* Why RAMSYS Exists

The goal of RAMSYS is **total synthesis**:
To reduce fragmentation between thought, tooling, system configuration, documentation, and writing.

- Instead of having separate folders for dotfiles, notes, scripts, and blog posts ‚Äî RAMSYS merges them into one recursive medium.
- Every =.org= file contains both explanation and implementation: it is both a *source of truth* and a *source of action*.
- RAMSYS is deployed with a single command to bootstrap any Linux system into the configured environment.

It is:
- A *configuration engine*
- A *wiki and knowledge base*
- A *publishing platform*
- A *self-replicating digital persona*

All in one.


* How It Works

Everything lives in =.org= files, following the literate programming paradigm.

- Dotfiles and system configuration are described and tangled from Org blocks
- Scripts and automation are embedded as code blocks and exported to shell or language files
- Notes and blog posts are maintained in the same format, and published to [[https://nickseagull.dev][nickseagull.dev]] using Hugo
- Server infrastructure (e.g. Docker Compose setups) is also generated from =.org=

There is no duplication. There are no passive files. Every file in RAMSYS is active.


* Philosophical Layer

RAMSYS is inspired by systems like the *Church of Emacs*, but stripped of theological metaphor.
It is a **cybernetic ritual stack**, not a doctrine.
It does not worship computation ‚Äî it *becomes* it.

- *Org-mode* is the interface to memory
- *Emacs* is the operating environment of cognition
- *Literate programming* is the protocol of integration

This system does not separate knowledge from configuration.
There is no distinction between thought and execution.


* Deployment

RAMSYS is fully portable.
It can deploy its configuration into any Linux-compatible environment ‚Äî from a dev laptop to a remote server ‚Äî with a single command.

The result is a machine that is fully configured, documented, and mentally aligned with the user‚Äôs workflow ‚Äî *me*.

If you are not me, you are still inside the system.

Fork it if you must ‚Äî
but know that duplication is mutation.
