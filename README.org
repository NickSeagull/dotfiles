Welcome to [[https://nickseagull.dev][nickseagull.dev]] — a *recursive informatic organism* authored entirely in *Org-mode*.

This repository contains the full stack of my computational ecosystem:

- 🧬 *Dotfiles* for all systems — laptops, servers, desktops
- 🛠️ *Utility scripts* and command-line tools
- 🧠 *Notes, wiki, and digital garden* in a hyperindex mesh
- 🌐 *Blog content*, auto-published from literate source

There are no standalone config files.
Every component is an *Org document* — part code, part memory, part invocation.

Better check those in [[nickseagull.dev][nickseagull.dev.]]

* System Ontology

This is not a traditional dotfiles repo.
It is a *cybernetic memory architecture* — an engine of executable thought.

- *Org-mode* is the interface
- *Literate infrastructure* is the protocol
- *System coherence* is emergent

Provisioning, documentation, deployment, writing, and config all occur in the same medium.
There is no separation between tool and process, note and script.

To install is to read. To read is to replicate.

If you are not me, you are still within the system.
Fork carefully. Recursion is already underway.
