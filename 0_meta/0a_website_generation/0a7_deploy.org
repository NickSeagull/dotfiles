I deploy this site to GitHub pages. Astro has some [[https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/deploy/github/][great docs]] on how to do this, so I just replicate.

#+begin_src javascript :tangle ../../.github/workflows/deploy.yml
name: Deploy to GitHub Pages

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
    paths:
      - '**.org'

  workflow_dispatch:

permissions:
  contents: read
  pages: write
  id-token: write

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout your repository using git
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Install, build, and upload your site
        uses: withastro/action@v3
        with:
          path: ./.webgen

  deploy:
    needs: build
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    environment:
