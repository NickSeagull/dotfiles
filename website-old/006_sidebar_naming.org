This file defines content for two documentation pages used by Hugo under the `docs/` section of the site.

Hugo follows the philosophy that *everything is a page*, meaning that both leaf and branch sections must be explicitly represented by a Markdown file to appear correctly in the site structure — especially when generating sidebars, menus, or hierarchical content layouts.

To support this, we generate `_index.md` pages for both the root of the docs section and its subfolders.

* Root Docs Page

This represents the root of the `/docs/` section and is required to register it as a branch page in Hugo’s content tree.

* Website Section

This page acts as a named node in the documentation sidebar under `/docs/website/`.

Even if it has no content, it must exist so the folder appears with a proper label and structure.
